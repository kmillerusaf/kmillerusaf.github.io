        <p>Client fingerprinting, in my opinion, is one of those features that many people don’t think about until they either need it, want it, or it's broken. It’s not as sexy as other Wi-Fi security related topics such as 802.1X or micro segmentation and it’s certainly not going to prevent a client from operating correctly on the network if it’s not available (or can it?). However, it does help provide insight into your Wi-Fi client base which can be valuable in terms of knowing what device or devices are popular and making sure your Wi-Fi supports …</p>

Being a SolarWinds Ambassador consists of writing 4 blog posts (1 per week) about topics that interest you, in relation to IT as a whole. My particular interests that I chose to write about revolved around networking monitoring. Although my schedule was slated to be very hectic that month, I decided to take on the challenge as it was something I had never done before and the opportunity wasn't guaranteed in the future.

        <p>I have a great announcement to make that is long overdue! The Pay It Forward (PIF) scholarship has its second recipient.</p>
<p>Sometime shortly after the new year, I was mulling over whether I would write a post asking for applications for this year's scholarship. I had just started my new job and I knew that this year would be extremely busy for me, both personally and professionally. I wasn't sure if I would be able to devote the funds or time to this valiant cause, however, I could not refuse this highly motivated individual. <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code></p>

The conference is scheduled for May18th - May 22nd in San Francisco, CA. By registering today and not waiting until January 14th or later, I saved \$400 off the registration price (pre-registration discount). This might not seem like much to some (\$400 has always been a lot to me), but when you look at the total cost of the trip which I estimate is going to cost \$3600, it makes sense to save wherever you can.<code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code></p>

        <p>2013 was a very eventful year and brought a lot of good things to my family and I. I changed jobs twice which brought me to an employer that I've wanted to work for over the past 2 years. The salary is decent, the benefits are good, and the people I work with are great! I have been challenged since day one to keep up with everything going on which is exactly what I was looking for. In addition to changing positions every quarter, I passed Juniper's JNCIA-Junos exam, Microsoft's MCITP (Windows 7) exam, and a couple of Cisco exams …</p>

        <p>Yesterday, I took and passed my first Juniper exam! Although I've been MIA from the blog, I haven't been MIA from studying and learning new things which included some studying for <a href="http://www.juniper.net">Juniper's</a> JNCIA-Junos (JN0-101) exam. I've known about Juniper's certification program for some time now, I just had no immediate plans to study for any of their exams and if you read on, it really made sense why.<code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code> I had no experience with any Juniper platforms and will continue to not work with their platforms in a work environment for the foreseeable future. So the question you probably have …</p>

        <p>Hey!</p>
<p>It seems like forever since my last post and I apologize for that but I have been particularly busy. Here's a quick update on what I've been up to over the last month or so.</p>
<p>I was contacted by another organization on base that had some interest in hiring me; they serve as a service provider and network architect team for us. When they first approached me, I was very interested in the position. I would be working with a dual CCIE and a bunch of really smart guys that seemed to enjoy their jobs. I would get to …</p>

        <p>Ever watched the TV show Kitchen Nightmares featuring the chef, Gordon Ramsey? One of the best chefs in the world visited struggling restaurants for a week in an attempt to get them back on the right track. Overwhelmed by the sheer negligence of the restaurant owners, Gordon struggles to stay a couple of days let alone an entire week. Eventually, a breakthrough occurs and he's able to just grin and bare it enough to get through the week just like many of us do regularly. Sound like a good show? I think I've got a better idea! <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code>How about …</p>

        <p><em>Full disclosure: This is only my 2nd experience with migrating a data center and the first time I was working with a much smaller network and infrastructure in general with a stacked pair of 3750s using static routes, some L2 2960s and a couple of ASA 5510s.</em></p>
<p>This last experience is what I'll be writing about. But first, let me give you some background on the data center before we moved. <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code>Our core was a pair of 6509s using VSS with a pair of stacked 3750s at the top of each server rack. We used 2x10G links in an …</p>

        <p>If you look in the dictionary for the word "packetologist", you won't find it. So what is a packetologist and why am I calling myself that? The truth is, I don't even know what a packetologist is but it was something that my co-workers called me one day in jest and I liked it, so I decided to run with it. Despite being a means of playing around with me, I also believe they made this term up because they know the passion that I have for most things technology related, especially when it comes to networking. Whenever an opportunity …</p>
