<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In my current role, we sometimes receive complaints about the Wi-Fi being slow or not working properly. When we ask what the issue is, we're often sent responses referring to speed test results only that are supposed to serve as the definitive proof that something's wrong with the Wi-Fi. What our user base often doesn't understand is that there are many variables when it comes to speed tests in general, but when running these speed tests while connected to Wi-Fi, even more variables exist. Let me try to explain.</p>

        <p>My employer is currently building a new home office (HO) campus. In every building except two infrastructure support buildings, we are installing Mist AP45s which are 6E capable. The two support buildings received AP43s which don’t support 6E, but are Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) capable and still very capable APs.</p>
<p>Why is that important? Well, as most if not all of you out there know by now, WPA3 is mandatory in 6 GHz. We haven’t deployed the AP45s in many places yet, so the new HO campus is an opportunity to really get our hands dirty with not …</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/images/tweet.png"></p>
<p>With the 280 character limit of Twitter (hard to believe it used to be 140), sometimes it's difficult to fully express an idea or the context behind it and instead of trying to create a messy, multi-threaded tweet, I just left it there as food for thought.

        <p>I’ve been doing less and less Python development since moving to a new company back in June. At my previous employer, I worked on Python command-line scripts and a custom-built web app fairly often that assisted with daily, monotonous tasks as well as troubleshooting. I really enjoyed the process of learning more about Python and developing tools that helped not just myself, but also my team.</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, I was reading something and power was given in milliwatts instead of dBm. I wanted to convert the values to dBm since it's the unit I'm most comfortable …</p>

        <p>So you've got that fancy new AP from VendorX with all the speeds and feeds, including multi-gigabit capability. Are you taking advantage of the increased speeds? How do you keep track of all your APs and the speeds they are linked up at?

        <p>I was recently asked to do a predictive design for a warehouse. Sounds innocent enough, except the floor plan was a picture of the floor plan made in an Excel spreadsheet. Up until this point, I had never dealt with something like this, but it immediately reminded me of this exchange on Twitter between Eduard Petrov and Vasco Costa a day or two before receiving it:</p>

        <p>Client fingerprinting, in my opinion, is one of those features that many people don’t think about until they either need it, want it, or it's broken. It’s not as sexy as other Wi-Fi security related topics such as 802.1X or micro segmentation and it’s certainly not going to prevent a client from operating correctly on the network if it’s not available (or can it?). However, it does help provide insight into your Wi-Fi client base which can be valuable in terms of knowing what device or devices are popular and making sure your Wi-Fi supports …</p>

        <p>I have a great announcement to make that is long overdue! The Pay It Forward (PIF) scholarship has its second recipient.</p>
<p>Sometime shortly after the new year, I was mulling over whether I would write a post asking for applications for this year's scholarship. I had just started my new job and I knew that this year would be extremely busy for me, both personally and professionally. I wasn't sure if I would be able to devote the funds or time to this valiant cause, however, I could not refuse this highly motivated individual. <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code></p>

        <p>As the title suggests, I pulled the trigger and I booked my <strong>FIRST</strong> trip to <a href="http://www.ciscolive.com/us/?cid=%20000334082">Cisco Live</a> US! The conference is scheduled for May18th - May 22nd in San Francisco, CA. By registering today and not waiting until January 14th or later, I saved \$400 off the registration price (pre-registration discount). This might not seem like much to some (\$400 has always been a lot to me), but when you look at the total cost of the trip which I estimate is going to cost \$3600, it makes sense to save wherever you can.<code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code></p>

        <p>2013 was a very eventful year and brought a lot of good things to my family and I. I changed jobs twice which brought me to an employer that I've wanted to work for over the past 2 years. The salary is decent, the benefits are good, and the people I work with are great! I have been challenged since day one to keep up with everything going on which is exactly what I was looking for. In addition to changing positions every quarter, I passed Juniper's JNCIA-Junos exam, Microsoft's MCITP (Windows 7) exam, and a couple of Cisco exams …</p>

        <p>I recently made some changes to the setup of my home network. Instead of a Linksys E3200 wireless router providing both wired and wireless access to the LAN and Internet, I added a Cisco ASA 5505 and a <a href="http://www.netgear.com/business/products/switches/smart-switches/smart-switches/GS108T.aspx">Netgear GS108T</a> switch to the mix. The network now looks like this:<code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code></p>

        <p>Today, I am proud to announce the creation of the Pay It Forward scholarship that I will be hosting at least once a year, for as long as I possibly can. The Pay It Forward scholarship consists of providing one deserving person with the goal of becoming a network professional, books to study from and paid vouchers for the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) exam when they are ready to test. Scholarship winners will not be ordinary people. They must demonstrate the willingness and drive to learn, despite whatever circumstances they have dealt with, that prevented them from being able …</p>

        <p>I've been afforded a lot of opportunities in my life and not all of them are what I would consider to have been earned. Most have been based on promise or potential while the rest were based on past performance, the latter being the vast minority.

It will certainly be bittersweet to a degree since I'll be able to see my former office whenever I come in and leave for the day but it was time for a change and I really feel like this was the best decision for me going forward.<code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code></p>

I've known about Juniper's certification program for some time now, I just had no immediate plans to study for any of their exams and if you read on, it really made sense why.<code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code> I had no experience with any Juniper platforms and will continue to not work with their platforms in a work environment for the foreseeable future.

<p>It seems like forever since my last post and I apologize for that but I have been particularly busy. Here's a quick update on what I've been up to over the last month or so.</p>
<p>I was contacted by another organization on base that had some interest in hiring me; they serve as a service provider and network architect team for us. When they first approached me, I was very interested in the position. I would be working with a dual CCIE and a bunch of really smart guys that seemed to enjoy their jobs. I would get to …</p>

        <p>Ever watched the TV show Kitchen Nightmares featuring the chef, Gordon Ramsey? One of the best chefs in the world visited struggling restaurants for a week in an attempt to get them back on the right track. Overwhelmed by the sheer negligence of the restaurant owners, Gordon struggles to stay a couple of days let alone an entire week. Eventually, a breakthrough occurs and he's able to just grin and bare it enough to get through the week just like many of us do regularly. Sound like a good show? I think I've got a better idea! <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code>How about …</p>

The truth is, I don't even know what a packetologist is but it was something that my co-workers called me one day in jest and I liked it, so I decided to run with it. Despite being a means of playing around with me, I also believe they made this term up because they know the passion that I have for most things technology related, especially when it comes to networking.
