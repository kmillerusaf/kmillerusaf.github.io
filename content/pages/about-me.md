[![Keith Miller](http://www.thepacketologist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/me.jpg){.wp-image-181 .alignleft width="140" height="140"}](http://www.thepacketologist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/me.jpg)My name is Keith Miller and I am a veteran of the United States Air Force where I served as a meteorologist (1W0X1). I've been in the networking industry since June of 2010. I have helped manage several types of networks including a campus enterprise network, data centers, and remote WAN sites consisting of firewalls, load-balancers, routers, switches, and wireless.

I hold several current, industry certifications that can be seen by viewing my LinkedIn profile.

Although computer networking is my main passion, I enjoy most things that are IT or technology related.Â I'm always looking for ways to improve myself and network with my peers in the industry so feel free to contact me if you'd like to exchange ideas!
