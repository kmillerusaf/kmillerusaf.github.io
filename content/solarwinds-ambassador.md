In January, I was honored with the offer to become a SolarWinds "Geek Speak" Ambassador for the month of February. Being a SolarWinds Ambassador consists of writing 4 blog posts (1 per week) about topics that interest you, in relation to IT as a whole. My particular interests that I chose to write about revolved around networking monitoring. Although my schedule was slated to be very hectic that month, I decided to take on the challenge as it was something I had never done before and the opportunity wasn't guaranteed in the future. I'm so glad I did it. If you're interested, the four posts are below:
